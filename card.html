			<p id="fact"> Our dogs have always been our best friends, our loyal companions and most importantly, our family. So it’s only natural that we are completely fascinated by dog facts and information. We’re utterly besotted with our four-pawed friends and want to discover absolutely everything possible about them, so when we hear a dog fact it fills us with a sense of joy and wonder.</p>
